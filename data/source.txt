The Complete PLANTS Checklist is nearly 7 MB and includes
Symbol, Synonym Symbol, Scientific Name with Authors, National Common Name, and Family.
Fields in this text file are delimited by commas and enclosed in double quotes.
You can import this file into many databases or spreadsheets.
For example, first save the .txt file, then open in Microsoft Excel by specifying
"Text Files" in the file type scroll box, and import by specifying "Comma" as the delimiter.
Or use the file directly in Excel: copy it from the screen, paste it into a new worksheet,
and select "Text to Columns..." from the Data menu. The complete PLANTS checklist may have
more records than Excel allows, so you might need to split it into two worksheets.
